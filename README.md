## Why Am I doing this?

For a book database library final project.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

My CRUD and testing went well at first. Which actually the only thing that went well. Aside from that, everything did not go as planned. Especially the broken controlled tests and persistence errors in the database. There is also the fact that I failed to implement my desired text/PDF into MySQL.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

With a future revision, I plan to create a fully working library borrowing service with a front end. 1. Users can borrow books
2. Each user has an ID assigned 
3. Each ID is holds their borrowed book, 
4. Each ID shows their balance (borrowing power) 
5. Each ID shows how long they have had a book. 
6. Additionally a record of what books are missing.
